## About Morning GitHub Review

[![GitHub App Review - Repositories view][app-screenshot]](https://github.com/rawic/github-review)

When I realized that **I lacked knowledge about React and data fetching**, I decided to create a project using the **GitHub API** (which is definitely amazing! ðŸ”¥). There are many things to improve (mostly in UI and UX) but that it is not the main goal of the project. Just bare in mind.

### Built With
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
* [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/)
* [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
* [GitHub GraphQL API](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql)
* [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
* [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)

## TODO
Basic functionality:
* Fetching repositories based on a search input
* Fetching a repository, latest commits and contributors
* Fetching users

General:
* Add Getting Started section to readme
* Add Acknowledgements section to readme
* Add live demo

#### TODO next: ####
* Update the readme with the GitHub API endpoints used
* Write tests with Jest/React Testing Library (*)
* Implement TypeScript?
* Add the "People" page
* Add the "Issues" page

<div>* Yeah it's not the best idea to start writing tests scenarios when over 50% of the app is completed but I wanted to focus on as few things as possible at the same time.</div>

**_I'll update this readme over time._**
